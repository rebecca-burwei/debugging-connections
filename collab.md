# Who works on Tech Transplanted?

*Tech Transplanted*, the blog, was started by Rebecca BurWei in Sept 2020, but I've been dreaming about these ideas for much longer. 

I am a second-generation tech worker, child of im/migrants, beneficiary of return migration, East Asian, cishet woman grounded in the US Midwest.

If the ideas on this blog resonate with you, I'm very open to working together and growing the *Tech Transplanted* crew. Please [reach out](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=let's work together).

# Want to collaborate? 

*Tech Transplanted* is open to creative ideas from data deep dives to facilitating workshops. We're up for pretty much anything that aligns with the [vision and scope]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}).

We're especially interested in:
* Community discussions related to blog post topics
* Translation and localization
* Interviewing and elevating cross-border stories

Just [drop us a line](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=let's work together)!
