Debugging Connection is a Jekyll site hosted on GitHub pages using the [Clean Blog Jekyll](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/clean-blog-jekyll/) theme from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/). 

To manage email subscriptions, we use [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com). To style the subscription form in the website's footer, we used [tips](https://uhurunetwork.com/customizing-mailchimp-form-design/) from Vanessa Rodriguez Lang at Uhuru Network.
