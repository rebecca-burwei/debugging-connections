Every year, millions of people move across the world for work. Over 164 million[^1] people are im/migrant workers, and the number moving because of the tech industry has increased dramatically.<br /><br />

Would you move across the world to work in tech? Have you done it already? This blog is for you.<br />

Are your co-workers im/migrants? Do you think about becoming an expat[^2]? This blog is for you.<br />

Why do some people move to jobs, some jobs move to people, and other jobs get automated? More importantly, what is the point of all this movement of people and technology? Who benefits from this movement, and what social connections are we building along the way?<br />

On *Tech Transplanted*, we dig deep into how workers across the tech industry are connected. We decolonize and de-modularize the ways we’re used to seeing each other. We recognize that upholding international power hierarchies, nationalism and borders benefit some of us in the short term and harms all of us in the long run. <br />

To restore our connections, we:

* Search for the relationships lost in migration, 
* Liquify social capital, and
* Share knowledge.

*Tech Transplanted* is a conversation. We practice community and learn from one another's experiences. You are welcome to [join in]({{ site.baseurl }}) or [propose a collaboration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link collab.md %})!<br /><br />

[^2]: Why do we call some people expats and others immigrants? Expat, short for expatriate, colloquially refers to a person from a rich country, typically a working professional or a retiree. Immigrants, on the other hand, usually refer to people from poor countries, regardless of job or skill. These labels assume people from poor countries should assimilate and break ties with their home countries, while upper-class people from rich countries retain their national identities and resist integration with local communities.
